# mbed-os-example-aws-greengrass

This repository contains the code examples for AWS Greengrass - publisher and subscriber.

The applications connect to a Wi-Fi network as a STA(client), discover Greengrass core devices, establish a secure TCP connection over MQTT to the AWS Greengrass endpoint and publish or subscribe messages periodically to/from the AWS cloud
